# later-jwdca

After pulling this repository, run the following commands in a command line terminal to build and execute the project: 

### To build the project run:
```
npm install
```

### To execute the project run:
```
npm run serve
```

The project should open in a new browser tab. If not go to the url specified in 'Local' by the command line you used in the previous instruction:

ie.
``` 
App running at:
  - Local:   http://localhost:8080/
```

I used a lot of font, margin, and color values from later.com because the style guide didn't match a lot of what I saw. If you'd like to see an example that was more true to the style guide, you can check my previous draft by appending "/stylesheet" to the url that is currently running the project:

ie.
``` 
http://localhost:8080/stylesheet
```
